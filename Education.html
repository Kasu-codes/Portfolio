            <h1>Well as for my Education <span>I am in college doing BCA </span></h1>
            <p>Which is Bachelor of Computer Applications at PT. SUKHRAJ RAGHUNATHI INSTITUTE OF EDU. & TECHNOLOGY Pratapgarh U.P. I am in my 3rd sem right now (with two backs in maths xD) unfortunatly i am kinda weak in maths but i am trying to improve so let's see, after this i am planning to do MCA which is Masters in Computer Applications. Other than that I mostly do self study and try to improve my skills by my own (Although i am very lazy lol) but yea that's it for now and I will keep updating here so wish me good luck :). </p>
